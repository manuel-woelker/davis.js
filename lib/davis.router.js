/**
 * A decorator that adds convinience methods to a Davis.App for easily creating instances
 * of Davis.Route and looking up routes for a particular request.
 *
 * Provides get, post put and delete method shortcuts for creating instances of Davis.Routes
 * with the corresponding method.  This allows simple REST styled routing for a client side
 * JavaScript application.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 *     app.get('/foo/:id', function (req) {
 *       // get the foo with id = req.params['id']
 *     })
 *     
 *     app.post('/foo', function (req) {
 *       // create a new instance of foo with req.params
 *     })
 *     
 *     app.put('/foo/:id', function (req) {
 *       // update the instance of foo with id = req.params['id']
 *     })
 *     
 *     app.del('/foo/:id', function (req) {
 *       // delete the instance of foo with id = req.params['id']
 *     })
 *
 * As well as providing convinience methods for creating instances of Davis.Routes the router
 * also provides methods for creating special instances of routes called filters.  Before filters
 * run before any matching route is run, and after filters run after any matched route has run.
 * A before filter can return false to halt the running of any matched routes or other before filters.
 *
 * A filter can take an optional path to match on, or without a path will match every request.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 *     app.before('/foo/:id', function (req) {
 *       // will only run before request matching '/foo/:id'
 *     })
 *     
 *     app.before(function (req) {
 *       // will run before all routes
 *     })
 *     
 *     app.after('/foo/:id', function (req) {
 *       // will only run after routes matching '/foo/:id'
 *     })
 *     
 *     app.after(function (req) {
 *       // will run after all routes
 *     })
 *
 * Another special kind of route, called state routes, are also generated using the router.  State routes
 * are for requests that will not change the current page location.  Instead the page location will remain
 * the same but the current state of the page has changed.  This allows for states which the server will not
 * be expected to know about and support.
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 *     app.state('/foo/:id', function (req) {
 *       // will run when the app transitions into the '/foo/:id' state.
 *     })
 *
 * Using the `trans` method an app can transition to these kind of states without changing the url location.
